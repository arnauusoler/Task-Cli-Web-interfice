# Task-Cli-Web-interfice
This project is a simple task manager with a web-based interface. It allows users to add, update, delete, and filter tasks through an easy-to-use browser interface. Tasks are stored locally in the browser's localStorage, ensuring persistence across sessions without any backend server.
